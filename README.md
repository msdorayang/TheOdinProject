# odin-calculator

This is my final project for the Odin Project's Foundations course. It is a basic calculator that can do basic calculations for integers and decimal numbers (add, subtract, multiply, and divide). Answers are displayed up to 3 decimal places.
Possible future functionalities not implemented here includes:
- backspace button to undo mistakes
- keyboard support
